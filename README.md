## üìù Overview

**Aenigma** is a free and open-source Android application focused on secure, private communication 
through **end-to-end encryption** using **public key cryptography**.

- Anonymous sign-up with **no personal information required**
- No data collection or processing
- Built with transparency, privacy, and user autonomy in mind


## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to clone, configure, and build the Aenigma project on your local machine.

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before building the application, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- Android SDK
- Android NDK (Side by side)
- Android Emulator _or_ a physical Android device

> These instructions are tailored for **Ubuntu Linux** distributions but can be adapted for other platforms.

### üì• Clone the Repository

Clone the project using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/m3sserschmitt/aenigma-android.git --recursive
```

## üîê OpenSSL Integration & NDK Setup - [OPTIONAL]

This application statically links against the [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) cryptographic 
library. A **pre-built version of OpenSSL (‚â• 3.0)** is included directly in the project repository 
for convenience.

If you prefer to build the OpenSSL library yourself, an **automation script** is available:

```bash
cd ./app/src/main/cpp
export ANDROID_NDK_ROOT=<sdk-path>/ndk/<ndk-version>
export PATH=$ANDROID_NDK_ROOT/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/<system>/bin:$PATH
./make-openssl.sh
```

>In the previous commands `<ndk-version>` is your installed NDK version,
>`<sdk-path>` is the path of your installed Android SDK and
>`<system>` is your local machine OS: `linux-x86_64`, `darwin-x86_64` `windows-x86_64` or `windows`.

After completing this step you are
ready to open the project into Android Studio IDE to build the application.
